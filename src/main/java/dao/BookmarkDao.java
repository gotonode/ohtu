	// Should this class handle things like getting every bookmark, no matter the type?
	// Or should we get all bookmarks individually by combining
	// the findAll results from all DAO's that inherit from the Bookmark-class?
	// If possible, this class could return all results, when we don't want to get e.g. just the blog posts.
