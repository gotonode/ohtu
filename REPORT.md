# Course report

This is **Return Zero**'s report on the course and it's miniproject. It's a project's post-mortem report.

### Problems encountered in each sprint

These include problems in the process, teamwork and on the technical side. Due to the good exercises done prior to starting the miniproject, many technical issues faced weren't carried over to the actual miniproject.

#### Problems in sprint 1
* Duplicate tabs were inserted by IntelliJ IDEA, which annoyed other members (Riku)

#### Problems in sprint 2
* none

#### Problems in sprint 3
* none

#### Problems in sprint 4
* none

### What went well and what should be improved on future projects

Our team's synergy was optimal. We held regular meetings regarding the project, where issues were discussed. We also held retrospectives, but those didn't turn out to be too useful since our communication during the sprints was so good, there often wasn't anything else to add.

### What we learned, what we would've liked to learn, and what felt useless

When working in a Scrum team, even a simple task that could be done in an evening can be strected out to a week's worth of work. Software development in a team adds many layers work in addition to the actual programming (including documentation).

Being able to elevate and use what other people have learned will work in the benefit of the project, and of each individual in the long run. For a simple example, I (Riku) didn't know of `Cucumber`'s `Background`-feature, but once I saw that it was used, I figured that of course there had to be such a feature. In essence, each member of the development team brings in their own experise and special knowledge which can then be assimilated by the other members.
